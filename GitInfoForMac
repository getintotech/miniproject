Git + Netbeans for Mac

In Git Hub (MiniProject), click on Clone or download button.

Copy the link (https://github.com/getintotech/miniproject.git)

Open the terminal. Make sure you are in the directory where you project folder is located.

Type:
git clone https://github.com/getintotech/miniproject.git
in the terminal

In Netbeans, go to file -> new project
Browse to the project folder and select your blog folder (basically resetting-up the project)
Click next.

In next tab, on drop down run-as menu, select ‘PHP Built-in Web Server’
Click finish

To test:

Make a change to the code and save
Go to Team->Commit
(This is now saved locally)

To push it back to Git so everyone can see the changes,
Team->Remote->Push
(click next a few times)

Go back to Git, your changes should show up in green!

Let me know if this works!
