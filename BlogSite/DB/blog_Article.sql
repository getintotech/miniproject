INSERT INTO `Article` VALUES (1,1,5,'Hen Corner, Brentford','<p class=\"p1\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://breadangels.com/uploads/ancillary/image/4365f1c7a4c53ad49dc3f280ee0e35f0bb12e0f3.jpg\" alt=\"Hens Corner\" width=\"356\" height=\"356\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>6 minute drive, 30 minute walk</em></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Want a taste of the countryside in West London? Then Hen Corner in Brentford is perfect. The website promises &lsquo;the good life&rsquo;, and while there might not be a Felicity Kendal in sight, the smallholding created by Sara and her family is both restful and inspiring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Hen Corner, in the back of a Victorian terrace, is well worth a visit to see how even nestled in West London sustainable living can be upheld. They run courses ranging from &lsquo;Scones and Jam&rsquo;, through &lsquo;Cheese in a Day&rsquo; to Chicken and Bee Keeping hands on experiences. While your lunch break might not be enough time to fulfil one of these courses, it&rsquo;s still good to scout out what you might be able to do in the future!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">More to the point, Hen Corner has on sale eggs, honey and preserves (when in season), plus the chance to order and collect handmade fresh breads from their on site microbakery. What better way to escape from the hustle and bustle for half an hour?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, it&rsquo;s also an option to take your business meeting to Hen Corner, and even top it off with some teambuilding baking lessons in the afternoon. This means that if you needed another excuse to go and have a nosey, I think you&rsquo;ve just got it!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Hen Corner is a wonderful addition to my Sky-local repertoire, highly recommend.</p>','2016-07-19 20:30:56',1),(2,1,5,'Syon House and Park','<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.worldwanderingkiwi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/P5208910.jpg\" alt=\"Syon house\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" /></strong></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>6 minute drive, 25 minute walk</strong></em></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Ticket prices:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gardens and Conservatory only: &pound;7;</li>\r\n<li>Plus House: &pound;12.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Syon House and Park are absolutely beautiful. Apparently they are the last surviving ducal house and complete estate left in Greater London, and the 40 acres of garden really make it feel like you&rsquo;re not in London anymore!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The gardens are complete with the spectacular glasshouse and arboretum set in acres of stunning parkland. The House and Conservatory have been used in many filming projects, including ITV&rsquo;s Poirot, Downton Abbey, BBC&rsquo;s Great British Bake-off and most recently in the feature film &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&rdquo;. Magazines and fashion houses, including Hello Magazine, Tatler, Ford and Land Rover have also recently used Syon as a location, so if you&rsquo;re looking for a high class venue this is it!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Although the tickets are expensive and there is really too much to do to be worth seeing the house during your lunch break, there is the Garden Kitchen Restaurant available for meals throughout the day. The restaurant serves fresh new season vegetables and is a lovely place to eat if you fancy a change for your lunch and the opportunity to scout out the rest of the estate for a longer visit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://i1.getsurrey.co.uk/incoming/article10505715.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Afternoon-Tea-in-The-Estate-Grill.jpg\" alt=\"tea\" width=\"410\" height=\"273\" /></p>','2016-07-19 20:38:09',1),(3,1,7,'Tesco Extra Osterley','<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/15/article-2581541-1552C0EB000005DC-148_634x394.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"394\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Distance: 2 minute walk (if that!)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Luckily for the 7500 employees based at Sky Osterley, the campus also boasts an enormous Tesco Extra on Grant Way. This stupendously sized supermarket store is a haven for all of your shopping needs, comprising of not only your usual grocery options, but also clothing, electronic and homeware sections along with a Cafe and the largest selection of magazines in the UK (probably...).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">It is worth pointing out that the Cafe is less than magnificent, with usually only one staff member running the orders resulting in a decent wait for what is, at the end of the day, fairly standard food. However having said that, the Veggie burger with onion rings and chips is a definite winner and the Cafe does offer a tremendous store-wide vista across the aisle tops where you can people watch to your heart&rsquo;s content. Moreover, to get to the Cafe you must take a trip up the long shallow trolley escalators which frankly is an experience in itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Further features include free parking for three hours (provided you nip in to buy some cake first) (and provided you were actually too lazy to walk across the road), a petrol station, and plenty of space to run into learner drivers practicing their bay parking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In conclusion, a trip Tesco Extra is highly recommended if you need to buy some things, not in the least because it&rsquo;s really close to Sky and has pretty much everything you would expect from a supermarket.&nbsp;</p>','2016-07-19 21:06:17',1),(4,1,9,'Sky Studios','<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://www.scottfleary.com/images/uploads/channel_images/55/ssn2011_-_04__large.jpg\" alt=\"sky studios\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>0 minute walk (depending where you are!)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you need some lunch time entertainment, Sky is the perfect place to work if you want to be a bit nosey! By virtue of being a media company, there is always something going on, and even if there isn&rsquo;t a specific event happening you can still have a look round the studios to see Sky News and Sky Sports being filmed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Studios are located in the same courtyard as the Believe in Better building, but make sure you stay quiet while looking round the building so as not to disturb the filming!</p>','2016-07-19 21:08:45',1),(6,1,6,'The Loft','<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://bdaily.s3.amazonaws.com/images/large/611ee784c904b9482ab8679d821bf531094590f5.jpg\" alt=\"The Loft\" width=\"500\" height=\"234\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>0 minute walk (dependending on where your office is!)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Sedley Place has designed two flexible restaurant and entertainment spaces for Sky&rsquo;s flagship Osterley campus in West London,&nbsp;which together can seat 230 staff.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The Loft is housed in the Believe in Better Building, designed by Arup Associates and aims to deliver &ldquo;a world-class working and creative environment&rdquo; according to Sedley Place, which says it was required to harness this ambition in the new dining spaces.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The Loft has been created to offer Sky staff more than their previous restaurant, diner and deli options.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The new restaurant spaces can be&nbsp;reconfigured with furniture stowed or taken away for social events and the space can adapt to host live music. If it is being used for meetings tables can be joined together.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The kitchen has a post-industrial look with exposed structures, suspended lighting and curved banquette seating.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Sedley Place says it has been softened with an acoustic design that will absorb sound so conversations can be kept private and the atmosphere &ldquo;intimate and personal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo; seats people dining and the space will have the look and feel of a &ldquo;fashionable high street restaurant&rdquo; according to the consultancy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The Loft has rooftop views and a studio feel, which amplifies the exposed timber structure. Oiled timber floors, a steel-panelled bar, and counters with suspended industrial lighting completes the look.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">At the front of the loft bar a mosaic of brick pattern tiles has been integrated and seating is made up of high tables, small clusters and a long upholstered banquette table. Sliding windows open out onto a &ldquo;year round&rdquo; roof top deck.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Mick Nash, managing director at Sedley Place says: &ldquo;Sky doesn&rsquo;t just want catering; it wants to inspire and make its people feel looked after. We chose the furniture, fittings and overall design to create an ambiance that appealed to both hearts and minds, and to complement Gather &amp; Gather&rsquo;s excellent food offer.</p>','2016-07-19 21:19:24',1),(7,1,6,'Giant Chess','<p class=\"p1\"><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/chess.jpg\" alt=\"Chess\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>0 min walk</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Your lunch break isn&rsquo;t just for eating, it&rsquo;s about getting away from your work for a bit to come back feeling refreshed. If you&rsquo;re looking for both mental and physical exercise, how about a game of Giant Chess?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The board is outside Sky 6, and although you can play alone, we recommend bringing an opponent along to challenge you! However, it is important to note that a good difference in chess-playing ability is also recommended, because if you&rsquo;re too evenly matched and you get a bit of a stalemate, the game is likely to last longer than your break does!</p>','2016-07-19 21:22:07',1),(8,1,7,'Man Vs Food','<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/a5/71/fd/man-vs-food.jpg\" alt=\"ManvFood\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2 minute drive, 7 minute walk.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">How far wrong can you go with a restaurant that proudly states: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to eat healthily, but sometimes it&rsquo;s just as great to chow down, stuff your face and have a great time&rdquo;?!</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Man vs Food is a self proclaimed New-American diner, offering traditional American diner food as well as eating challenges similar to those featured in the popular tv programme of the same name.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">While there are your standard collection of burgers, hot dogs and chicken on offer, the menu also boasts some interesting items! Personally I haven&rsquo;t been brave enough to try it, but the burger section has in it the Krispy Kreme burger &ndash; a 4oz patty with bacon and cheese in between two Krispy Kreme Original Glazed Doughnuts! Sounds like pure madness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Slightly less adventurous but odd nonetheless is Crunchy Cap&rsquo;n Chicken &ndash; chicken breast strips coated in breakfast cereal and served with a honey glaze. If you think you might have the stereotypical American sweet tooth then it might be the recipe for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Speaking of brave, the eating challenges at Man vs Food are famous, and famously difficult! Challenges include the self explanatory Metre-Long Hot Dog as well as the 30 Wing Challenge, but perhaps most difficult of all is the dangerously-named Fire in the Hole. To have a go at the Fire in the Hole challenge participants must sign a waiver form to declare they are aware of the risks as according to the &lsquo;Horror Stories&rsquo; section of their website 20 people have been sent to hospital directly from the restaurant. Check out the webpage if you want to see some videos of customers&rsquo; reactions to taking part in the challenge!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">However, it is important to note that you can go to Man vs Food for a good time and not necessarily to eat yourself silly! A particular highlight for me is either the Ferrero Rocher or Reece&rsquo;s Peanut Butter Cup milkshakes, strongly recommend!&nbsp;</p>','2016-07-19 21:25:16',1);
