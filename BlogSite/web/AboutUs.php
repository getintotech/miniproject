        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><font face="verdana">You often read stories of entrepreneurs who came up with their million pound ideas<br> over a couple of beers with friends. Not us. 
      You even hear those feel good stories of <br>university roommates and best friends who started a company together. Not us either. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We came together because we were on a course that promised to get women into <br>technology and our group task was to create a blog. 
      <br>
      <br>
      So here we are The DevelopHers and this is our blog! </font></p>
